# A meshlock Flet app

An example of a minimal Flet app.

To run the app:

```
Python venv module
You can create virtual environment by running the following commands in your terminal:
```

Linux

mkdir first-flet-app
cd first-flet-app
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

```

```

Windows
md first-flet-app
cd first-flet-app
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

```
Once you activated virtual environment, you'll see that your prompt now shows (.venv) prefix.

Now you can install the latest version of Flet in .venv virtual environment:

```

```
pip install flet

```

```
pip install pyotp
```

```
To check what version of Flet was installed:

flet --version
```

```

flet run [app_directory]

```

```

```
